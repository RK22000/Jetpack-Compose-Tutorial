# Jetpack-Compose-Tutorial
This is me making the tutorial project at https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial


Overall thoughts, compose is a cool way to code. I liked how everything was being done in one language. 
The logic is done with kotlin and the ui is also done with kotlin. 
This is better than switching between java/kotlin and xml. 
I do however miss having a gui to develop the ui.
Compose has the preview but it just does not feel the same. 
This might just be a matter of getting used to though.

Try out the tutorial yourself. What do you think of compose?
